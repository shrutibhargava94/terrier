Gandhinagar is located approximately 23 km North from Ahmedabad, the largest city of Gujarat, on the west central point of the Industrial corridor between Delhi, the political capital of India, and Mumbai, the financial capital of India.

Gandhinagar, Gujarat's new capital city, lies on the west bank of the Sabarmati River, about 464 km away from Mumbai, the financial capital of India.[1]

Thirty sectors, into which the city has been divided, stretch around the central Government complex. Each sector has its own shopping and community center, primary school, health center, government and private housing.[1] There is a provision for of parks, extensive planting and a recreational area along the river giving the city a green garden-city atmosphere.[1]

The Akshardham temple is located in Gandhinagar. There was a determination to make Gandhinagar a purely Indian enterprise, partly because the state of Gujarat was the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi.[1] and hence the planning was done by two Indian Town Planners; Prakash M Apte & H. K. Mewada, who had apprenticed with Le Corbusier in Chandigarh.
